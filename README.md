 ### 1. Introduction 
 
 This test plan describes the strategies, process, the way to organize the test cases and methodologies used to plan, execute and manage testing process for OrangeHRM browser application.

#### 1.1. Project Objective

The scope of the final project for the ITF Manual & Automation Testing Course is to apply all the knowledge gained during the course and to apply them in practice using a live application.

- [Application under test](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login )

- [Application documentation](https://www.orangehrm.com/assets/Files/Complete-Administrative-User-Guide.pdf?url=/Files/Complete-Administrative-User-Guide.pdf  )

Tools used:

- Jira
- Postman
- MySQL

#### 1.2. Functionalities in scope

All features of Job and Organization from Admin Module which were defined in software requirement specs need to be: functional testing, GUI testing, API testing  

#### 1.3. Functionalities and tests out of scope

- All OrangeHRM features except Job and Organization from Admin Module
- Non-functional testing like stress, performance is beyond scope of this project.
- No QA support for mobile application developed. Only web application will be tested.
- Automation testing is beyond scope.


### 2. Test process

#### 2.1. Test planning

#### Roles and responsibilities

| QA Engineer  | Gabor Sabina |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Product Owner  | Popa Iulian  |
| Project Manager  | Georgescu Marian  |
| Softuware Developer | Florea Andrei  |
| Senior QA Engineer | Ionescu Laura  |

#### Entry criteria
- functional specifications defined 
- roles needed for the project are allocated 
- initial project risks were detected and mitigated 

#### Exit criteria
- all test cases have been executed 
-	the number of unresolved bugs is insignificant or have low priority 
-	all resolved bugs have been re-tested and closed by QA team 
-	deadline was reached 
-	no detected major risks remained un-mitigated 

#### Risks
Project risks:
-	lack of experience of the QA team 
-	only one QA in the QA team 
-	unavailability of the test environment 
-	short deadline of Zephyr Squad and Jira tools 

Product risks: 
- validation constraints on the fields might be too restrictive to the end user.

#### 2.2. Test analysis 
-	Analyze business requirements to make sure that we have all the details for creating the test conditions 
-	Write test conditions that will be tested in out test process

#### 2.3. Test design
-	Functional test cases will be created in Zephyr Squad 
-	GUI test cases will be created in Zephyr Squad
-	API test cases will be created in Postman 
-	The test design techniques used for generating test cases are: equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis.
Jira:

![Test Cases and Test Conditions.2](https://github.com/SabinaGabor/Proiect-Final-TM/blob/main/Test%20Cases%20and%20Test%20Conditions.2.png)

#### 2.4. Test implementation
Verify that the following elements are ready before the test execution phase: 
-	test environment is up and running: [Application link](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login)
-	access to the test environment is given: username Admin, pass: admin123
-	Cycle summary was created 
-	the test cases were added to the cycle summary 
-	Postman collections were created 

#### 2.5. Test execution
-	Test cases are executed on the created Cycle summary 
-	Bugs were created based on the failed test cases. 
-	API test cases were executed 
-	Full regression pack was executed 

#### 2.6. Test closure
-	As the exit criteria were met and satisfied as mentioned in the 2.1 section, this feature is suggested to go live by the QA team. 
-	All test cases have been executed 
-	The number of unresolved bugs is insignificant or have low priority 
-	All resolved bugs have been re-tested and closed by QA team 
-	Deadline was reached 
-	No detected major risks remained un-mitigated 

#### 2.7. Test monitoring and control
-	Generate periodic reports to check the project status: status for the test cases executed, status for the converge of the business requirements, etc
